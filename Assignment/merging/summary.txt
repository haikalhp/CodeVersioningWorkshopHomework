Git merging is the process of combining the changes from one branch into another, typically bringing a feature branch back into the main branch (often called "master"). It integrates the isolated work back into the main line of development. Git automatically handles straightforward merges, but if there are conflicting changes, it prompts the user to resolve them. This ensures that multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously and then merge their work together. Merging is a fundamental part of Git's collaborative workflow.
