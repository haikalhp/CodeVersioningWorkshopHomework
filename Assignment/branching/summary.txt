A GitHub branch is a separate line of development in a Git repository, allowing you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. The default branch is usually called "master". You can create, switch, and merge branches, and commit changes to them. Meaningful branch names help track purposes (e.g., "feature/add-login-page"). Remote branches on platforms like GitHub facilitate collaboration. Branching is crucial for organized and concurrent development in Git.
